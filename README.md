# NECCDC-2017-Configs
This repo is an archive of the configs used to deploy all of the infrastructure during the Northeastern Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition ([NECCDC](http://neccdc.net/wordpress/))

Each subdirectory contains a README explaining the contents of that directory (prod topology in AWS, corp topology, blue team web app, etc).
